Build on your counting skills to create a fully functional digital clock. You'll learn why your Cascading
Digit Counter jumps numbers while counting and how to generate precise timing signals with a 555
timer chip. Then we will figure out how to make your counter reset at exactly 60 seconds or 24 hours so
that your final clock can display hours and minutes in HH:MM format, and add buttons for setting the time.
