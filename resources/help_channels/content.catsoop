### Debugging Checklist

Before asking for help, try these:

**Power**
- [ ] Is Vcc getting +5V?
- [ ] Is GND properly connected?
- [ ] Are power rails continuous on breadboard?

**Connections**
- [ ] Are all wires firmly inserted?
- [ ] Is IC oriented correctly (notch/dot at pin 1)?
- [ ] Are components in the right holes?

**Components**
- [ ] Are LEDs oriented correctly (long leg = anode)?
- [ ] Are capacitors correctly polarized (if electrolytic)?
- [ ] Are you using the right IC (check chip number)?
- [ ] Are resistor values correct (color code)?

**Logic**
- [ ] Does your circuit match the schematic?
- [ ] Are signals going to the right pins?
- [ ] Is your clock signal working?

**Still stuck?** → Ask on WhatsApp or Piazza!

### How to Ask Good Questions

Include:
- Which exercise/project you're working on
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happens
- What you've already tried
- Clear photos of your circuit (top view, good lighting)
- Schematic if you have one

Good example:
```
Module 1, Exercise 2
Problem: My CD4026 isn't counting. Display stays at 0.
What I tried: 
- Verified 5V on pin 16, GND on pin 8
- Checked clock signal with LED - it's blinking
- Reset pin (15) is connected to GND

```

Bad example:
```
"It doesn't work help"
```
